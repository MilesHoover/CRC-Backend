This is the backend portion of my Cloud Resume Challenge Project. 

The Cloud Resume Challenge, created by the talented Forrest Brazeal, is a project to build a personal resume website and page view count function from scratch using several cloud services. On top of this, you are tasked with implementing several common practices in DevOps such as provisioning infrastructure as code (IaC), Creating a continuous integration & continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate your workflow, and designing thorough unit tests to make sure your code works flawlessly.
